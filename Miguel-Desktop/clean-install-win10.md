# Clean Install Of Windows 10

## Before Re-install


 - Backup any save data that is not stored in the Cloud.
  - Darksouls 1, 3, and remaster saves are all stored in Documents, which is now backed up in One Drive, so not as concerned.
  - Particularly: Magicite, Darksouls 2, Warcraft3, Warcraft2, StarCraft, or any other game/config that doesn't save to the Cloud or connected NAS.
  - If you don't have a full backup of users, make sure to at least grab config data from AppData for programs with a more involved setup (i.e. Anki)
 - Make note of any programs that have been added/removed from this list since the last time you performed a fresh install.
 - Create a Windows installer: [detailed Instructions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10?d2784474-fdb0-4e9d-9e47-5e88c0e053ec=True)

1. Kill any unnecessary processes and remove any bloatware that came with the fresh install.
2. Perform a benchmark test using Windows built in Performance Monditor.

  2. Save this report for future reference
 
III. Map network drives to access any backup data (if backing up to a NAS).
IV. Now download and install windows environment improvements/Utilities.
